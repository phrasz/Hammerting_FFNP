*Callstack (if a crash)**  
NONE (active bug no crashing)

**Describe the bug**  
Under certain conditions, the alcoves will "blackout" and no longer render their interiors.
ALL other parts of the game continue to function.

**To Reproduce**  
Run game in a window (did NOT test in fullscreen)
Run the included game save: [LINK HERE](https://github.com/phrasz/Hammerting_FFNP/raw/main/Bugs/01/Bug_Phrasz_01_submission-Blackout-Alcoves.save)

Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1. Zoom in on the "apartment" of dwellings (about 5 clicks from max zoom) on the RIGHT of the Arcane Workshop
2. Bring the mouse cursor in towards the center of dwellings
3. Then move the mouse to the Arcane Workshop
4. Alternatively, move the screen around to include/exclude the Arcane Workshop

**Expected behavior**  
No graphical bug

**Desktop (please complete the following information if pertinent):**  
 - OS: Windows 10 Home (19042.1052)
 - Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (in a Laptop -- not "explictly" a mobile version) (471.11)
 - Game Version: Steam 0.4.0.32

**Additional context**  
1. See Discord for the original talk/chat.
2. While the bug center's around the Arcance Workshop I cannot say 100% it was causing "Disco Mode". (e.g., the Infirmary, Workshop, AND Mountain Entrance WILL blackout when centering them)
